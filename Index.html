  <p>I spent my time during the pamdemic playing games online. I also got a babysitting job with my twin sister. We spent most of our mornings with the children then we would go home and rest. once school started we had to quit babysitting and focus on that.</p>
  <p>Three things I like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing video games</li>
    <li>Making Tiktoks</li>
    <li>Hanging out with my friends</li>
  </ul>
